# FYP2020_CODE
Repository for code and graphs used for Imperial College Final Year Project

The model folder contains the codes for the models implemented as well as the data required to run the models.

The user is adviced to install Keras, Anaconda Distribution, meteostat and scikit-learn in order to be able to test the model. 
Python 3.8 is used for this project. 

Beware, this models are computationally intense therefore a device with sufficient RAM and processing speed is required.
